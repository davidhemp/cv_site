							We demonstrate a classical analogy to the Fano anti-resonance in levitated optomechanics by applying a DC electric field. Specifically, we experimentally tune the Fano parameter by applying a DC voltage from 0 kV to 10 kV on a nearby charged needle tip. We find consistent results across negative and positive needle voltages, with the Fano line-shape feature able to exist at both higher and lower frequencies than the fundamental oscillator frequency. We can use the Fano parameter to characterize our system to be sensitive to static interactions which are ever-present. Currently, we can distinguish a static Coulomb force of 2.7 ± 0.5 × 10−15 N with the Fano parameter, which is measured with 1 s of integration time. Furthermore, we are able to extract the charge to mass ratio of the trapped nanoparticle.

							Levitated optomechanics is showing potential for precise force measurements. Here, we report a case study to show experimentally the capacity of such a force sensor, using an electric field as a tool to detect a Coulomb force applied onto a levitated nanosphere. We experimentally observe the spatial displacement of up to 6.6 nm of the levitated nanosphere by imposing a DC field. We further apply an AC field and demonstrate resonant enhancement of force sensing when a driving frequency, ωAC, and the frequency of the levitated mechanical oscillator, ω0, converge. We directly measure a force of 3.0 ± 1.5 × 10–20 N with 10 s integration time, at a centre of mass temperature of 3 K and at a pressure of 1.6 × 10–5 mbar.

							Levitated optomechanics, a new experimental physics platform, holds promise for fundamental science and quantum technological sensing applications. We demonstrate a simple and robust geometry for optical trapping in vacuum of a single nanoparticle based on a parabolic mirror and the optical gradient force. We demonstrate parametric feedback cooling of all three motional degrees of freedom from room temperature to a few millikelvin. A single laser at 1550 nm and a single photodiode are used for trapping, position detection, and cooling for all three dimensions. Particles with diameters from 26 to 160 nm are trapped without feedback to 10−5  mbar, and with feedback-engaged, the pressure is reduced to 10−6  mbar. Modifications to the harmonic motion in the presence of noise and feedback are studied, and an experimental mechanical quality factor in excess of 4×107 is evaluated. This particle manipulation is key to building a nanoparticle matter-wave interferometer in order to test the quantum superposition principle in the macroscopic domain.

							We experimentally squeeze the thermal motional state of an optically levitated nanosphere by fast switching between two trapping frequencies. The measured phase-space distribution of the center of mass of our particle shows the typical shape of a squeezed thermal state, from which we infer up to 2.7 dB of squeezing along one motional direction. In these experiments the average thermal occupancy is high and, even after squeezing, the motional state remains in the remit of classical statistical mechanics. Nevertheless, we argue that the manipulation scheme described here could be used to achieve squeezing in the quantum regime if preceded by cooling of the levitated mechanical oscillator. Additionally, a higher degree of squeezing could, in principle, be achieved by repeating the frequency-switching protocol multiple times.
