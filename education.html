							Optomechanical sensors for detecting spin, gravitation effects, dark matter and dark energy. This involves trapping a nanoparticle, a sub-micro sphere of Silica, within the focus of a laser and observing how its motion changes in the presence of the test force. Averaging and data analysis techniques are used reduce the noise and push to reach the limits of the system. That system was modelled mathematically and numerically in Python using NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib. Complex analysis sometimes involved of the use of the University of Southampton's computational cluster (Iridis) which was does using PyMPI.

								The use of levitated optomechanical systems as force sensors is a growing field with great potential. This thesis presents a system that achieves a sensitivity of ≈10-22 N / √Hz by using on-resonance forces and an optically levitated nanoparticle in a gradient force trap. It is possible to reach pressures of 10-6 mbar and trap particles with diameters of 50 nm to 300 nm. The particle's motion is detected with a homodyne-like detection system that measures the phase difference in the scattered and un-scattered, divergent, light. With this system it was possible to detect the changes in the particle's motion due to the application of an external AC and DC electric fields. DC electric fields showed a shift in the average position of up to 100 nm and also a shift of the relevant oscillator frequency of up to 1500 Hz. Applying an AC electric field resulted in the particle's motion being driven at the AC frequency. On resonance the detected signal increased by a factor of 200 which helps to measure smaller changes in the particle's motion compared to the undriven signal. Using the AC driving it was possible to detect a particle with a charge of just 4 ± 3 electrons.
