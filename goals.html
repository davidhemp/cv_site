					I joined the HPC team in 2017 where I help look after the Iridis clusters while also being the primary contact for the Rolls-Royce UTC clusters. On the day-to-day side I help users with any issues they are having running their jobs on the clusters either via our forums, ticketing system, or by going to see them in-person. I also ensure the clusters themselves are running correctly and liaise with our suppliers regarding any issues that require additional input or replacement hardware. My personal interests in HPC are in emerging technologies such as containers and VMs. I believe that are many advantages to researches embracing these technologies into their workflow such as stability, reproducibility and portability. I am member of the Society of Research Software Engineering and enjoy working with researchers to solve the HPC problems.
